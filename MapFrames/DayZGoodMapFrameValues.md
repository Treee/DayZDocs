# What Are Good DayZ Map Frame Values?

## Intro

Welcome to the wonderful world of DayZ map making. You like many others are taking your first steps on a long journey that begins with pain and suffering but ends with a sense of accomplishment and progression.

## Prerequisites

We could spend hours talking about map making so for this video I will focus mostly on summarizing the excellent [Mapframe Information](https://github.com/pennyworth12345/A3_MMSI/wiki/Mapframe-Information) content provided by `pennyworth12345` and how the Mapframe values relate to one another. If you are watching purely for educational purposes there are no prerequisites to follow along. If you want to be more hands on there are a few prerequisites

- `DayZ` installed
- `DayZ Tools` installed
- Extracted game data into `P:\`
- [Mikero's Tools](https://www.mikero.tools/) - All-in-One Installer downloaded and installed. (Do not install as administrator)
- Heightmap - (Generated by any of your favorite tools; GQIS and L3DT are popular with their respective pro's and con's)
- Satellite Map
- Mask
- Source folder in `P:\` - Use this video to "learn the basics" [Gramps 2 hour map guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KgE25NZ0lc)

## The Height Map

small explanation of height map

- https://github.com/pennyworth12345/A3_MMSI/wiki/Mapframe-Information#grid-size
- segway into how this relates to the cell size and why a lower one might be desired

cell size

- https://pmc.editing.wiki/doku.php?id=arma3:terrain:grid-cell-size
- review the numbers in the above link
- example of a map with 2m cell size and 10m cell size

Tiling of Satellite and Mask Images

- general explanation of table and image in below link
- https://pmc.editing.wiki/doku.php?id=arma3:terrain:grid-cell-size

- why you will always have stretching ALWAYS
- best case scenario, estimated size = actual calculations with overlap and total tiles in row (universal stretching overlap/2)

- worst case scenario

- estimated size != actual calculations
- several examples of "bad" map frame values and why
- explain the calculations

land grid

- explain how to calculate the land grid
- explain why poor overlaps cause "terrain" not to render or be out of map

- Map frame properties Calculations

- review the properties
- explain how to calculate the tiles in row
- show excel with all values
  -- showcase divisible by 4 rule
  -- showcase texture layer being what helps reduce large overlaps
